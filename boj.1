.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.B boj
[
.IR OPTION .\|.\|.\&
]
.I COMMAND
[
.IR ARG .\|.\|.\&
]
.
.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B boj
runs
.I COMMAND
and sends a message to the user containing its output (if any) and a meaningful
subject line.  No message is sent if  
.I COMMAND
exits normally (with status 0)
.B and
does not produce any output.
.
.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B -n
Don't send mail unless
.I COMMAND
exited with non-zero status, regardless of whether it produced any output.
.
.TP
.B -m
Always send mail, regardless of whether
.I COMMAND
exited with non-zero status or produced any output.
.
.TP
.B -k
Keep the output file.
.
.TP
.B -r
Remove the output file before exiting.  This is the default.
.
.TP
.BI -d " DIR"
Change to
.I DIR
before running the job.
.
.TP
.BI -g " FILE"
Skip the job if
.I FILE
exists.  The log file will record status
.BR SKIP .
.
.TP
.BI -o " FILE"
Put output in
.I FILE
rather than a temporary file in
.B /tmp
-- this implies option
.B -k
which can be overridden by option
.BR -r .
.
.TP
.BI -l " FILE"
Log the result in
.I FILE
rather than
.BR /var/log/boj.log .
The log entry consists of the result code
.BR OK ,
.BR FAIL ,
or
.B SKIP
followed by the time execution began, the time it ended,
and finally
.I COMMAND
along with its arguments.
.
.TP
.B -L
Log the result in
.BR ~/.bojlog .
This is the default if
.B /var/log/boj.log
is not writeable and
.B -p
is not specified.
.
.TP
.BI -f " ADDRESS"
Use
.I ADDRESS
as the sender of the notification.
.
.TP
.BI -t " ADDRESS"
Send the notification to
.IR ADDRESS .
.
.TP
.BI -s " STRING"
Use
.I STRING
as the subject of the notification.  The default subject is
.B [$H]: [$r] $c
(see
.B OUTPUT
below for a key to the embedded variables).
.
.TP
.BI -p " DIR"
Use
.I DIR
as the
.BR "project directory" .
(see below).
.
.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------
.
.SH PROJECTS
.
The
.BI -p " DIR"
option sets the following options:
.
.TP
.B -d
.I DIR
.
.TP
.B -g
norun
.
.TP
.B -o
boj.out
.
.TP
.B -l
boj.log
.
.P
It runs the executable at
.IR DIR /run
and sends a notification using the mail template in the first of the
following files that it finds in the project directory:
.
.TP
.RI mail. err
.TP
.RI mail. result
.TP
.R mail
.
.P
Here,
.I err
is the exit status of the executable and
.I result
is either
.B OK
or
.B FAIL
depending on whether the exit status was zero or not.  (No mail is ever sent
if the status is
.BR SKIP ,
i.e., if the job is skipped.
.
.P
A mail template must contain a complete and valid mail header followed by a
blank line, but no attempt is made to verify this.  Any lines that follow the
blank line will become part of the message body.
.P
If none of these files is found, a sensible default is used.
.
.P
To invoke the executable at
.IR DIR /run
with arguments, add them after the last option.
.P
To run an executable other than the file
.B run
in the project directory, add brackets around the executable name (or path) and
its arguments.  For example:
.
.P
.B boj -p
.I DIR
.B [
.I CMD ARG...
.B ]
.P
The brackets here are literals; they do not indicate optional arguments to
.BR boj .
They must occur as separate tokens (i.e., surrounded by whitespace) in order to
be recognized by
.BR boj .
.
If you omit the closing right bracket,
.B ./run
will be added as an additional option.  For example:
.
.P
.B boj -p
.I DIR
.B [ timeout 30
.P
will invoke
.P
.B timeout 30 ./run
.P
from within
.IR dir .
.
.P
Options
.BR -f ,
.BR -t ,
and
.B -s
are ignored unless a mail template could not be found.
.
.P
If the file
.B keepout
exists, the
.B -k
option is set.
.
.P
If the file
.B alwaysmail
exists, the
.B -m
option is set.
.
.P
If the file
.B nomail
exists, the
.B -n
option is set.
