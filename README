boj - run a batch job and mail its output


Description
-----------

boj is a simple shell script suitable for use as a cron job wrapper.  It runs
another script (or other executable) and mails the resulting output to the
user, unless the script exited normally and didn't produce any output.  (There
are options to modify this behavior.)

It also logs a timestamped record of the job, including an indication of its
success or failure, to /var/log/boj.log or ~/.bojlog or another specified file.


Prerequisites
-------------

zsh (The Z Shell) -- http://www.zsh.org/


Installation
------------

As root:

    # vi config.mk
    # make install

Or as another user:

    $ vi config.mk
    $ sudo make install


Options
-------

See the man page for details.


Examples
--------

Run a command and mail its output (if any) to yourself:

    $ boj /path/to/executable arg1 arg2 ...

Set the mail subject and recipient:

    $ boj -s 'Your job output' -t foo@example.com ...

Indicate the job's success or failure in the subject line:

    $ boj -s 'Job result: %r' ...

Run the _run_ executable in a "project directory":

    $ boj -p /path/to/project ...
